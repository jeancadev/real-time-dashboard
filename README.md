## Architecture and Diagram

The application follows a modular architecture and is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend:**
  - Developed with Flask.
  - Implements JWT authentication, CRUD for users, and historical records.
  - Uses APScheduler to automatically insert simulated weather and seismicity data.
  - Utilizes Flask-SocketIO for real-time notifications.

- **Frontend:**
  - Built with React, using modular components and CSS Modules for a modern design.
  - Integrates interactive charts with Recharts to visualize historical weather and seismicity data.
  - Uses react-toastify for notifications and robust state and authentication management.

- **Additional Services and Orchestration:**
  - **Docker & Docker Compose:** The entire environment (backend, frontend, Redis, Prometheus, Grafana) is containerized to ensure consistent and scalable deployment.
  - **CI/CD:** Pipeline configured with GitHub Actions for automated testing and continuous deployment.
  - **Caching:** Use of Redis to cache responses and reduce calls to external APIs.
  - **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana collect and visualize real-time performance metrics.
  - **WebSockets:** Used to send real-time notifications to the interface, eliminating constant polling.

## Application Features

### Backend
- **Authentication and User Management:** User registration, login, and authentication with JWT.
- **Automatic Record Insertion:** Use of APScheduler to insert simulated weather and seismicity data.
- **REST API:** Endpoints to query, insert, update, and delete records with pagination and filters.
- **WebSockets:** Use of Flask-SocketIO to send real-time notifications to users.
- **Response Caching:** Use of Redis to cache responses and reduce calls to external APIs.
- **Metrics and Monitoring:** Integration with Prometheus to collect performance metrics and Grafana to visualize them.

### Frontend
- **Modern Interface:** Built with React, modular components, and smooth animations.
- **Historical Data Visualization:** Interactive charts with Recharts to visualize historical weather and seismicity data.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Use of react-toastify for action alerts and authentication changes.
- **Pagination and Filter Controls:** Implementation of pagination and filters for large volumes of data.

### Additional Services and Improvements
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** Full containerization to ensure a consistent and scalable environment.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** Automated pipeline for tests, builds, and continuous deployment.
- **Monitoring:** Integration with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to collect and visualize performance metrics.
- **Cache:** Redis to improve performance on repetitive queries.
- **WebSockets:** For real-time notifications, eliminating the need for constant polling.

### CI/CD and Automatic Deployment
We use GitHub Actions to automate the quality and deployment of the application. Each push to the main branch triggers the pipeline which:
- **Runs tests on the backend.**
- **Builds the frontend application.**
- **Automatically deploys the application to the server via SSH and Docker Compose.**
The pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml` and can be customized according to project needs.

### Monitoring and Optimization
- **Prometheus:** Running at http://localhost:9090, collects metrics from the backend.
- **Grafana:** Dashboard at http://localhost:3001, visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus (default username/password: admin/secret).
- **Redis:** Response caching to improve performance and reduce load on the backend.

### Technical Stories and Achievements
- **WebSockets and Real-Time Notifications:** Successful integration of Flask-SocketIO and react-toastify.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automation of tests, builds, and continuous deployment with GitHub Actions.
- **Optimization and Scalability:** Use of APScheduler, Redis, pagination, and filters to handle large data volumes.
- **Full Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose orchestrate the entire application environment.

### Potential Future Improvements
- **HTTPS Integration and Additional Security:** Configure HTTPS with Nginx and Let's Encrypt.
- **UI/UX Refinement:** Improve animations, transitions, and user experience.
- **Advanced WebSockets:** Custom notifications and real-time updates for other components.
- **Query and Cache Optimization:** Review Redis usage and optimize database queries.
- **Horizontal Scalability:** Prepare the system for scalability with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
